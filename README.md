## What the heck is this all about?

### Background Story
Like the last time, this story is not very entertaining, because it _is_ the same story again: 
Inventor of this supercool **Superflag Bowl I** was [my teacher](https://github.com/Weissheiten/PHPGrundlagenMitschrift) @HTL3R; again, it was a little project in the course of the subject "web technologies".

### Steps

**1. Setup**
   * Composer (==> [Flag Shop](https://github.com/SabrinaNovak/Flags), [TYPO3 Fluid](https://packagist.org/packages/typo3fluid/fluid))

   * create ``flags.php``

**2. Flag Output JSON**

extend ``flags.php`` so that flags can be sent in the JSON format

**3. AJAX Fetch**
